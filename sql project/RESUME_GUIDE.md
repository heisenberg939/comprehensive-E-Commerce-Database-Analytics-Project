## Interview Talking Points

### Project Overview (30-second pitch):
"I developed a comprehensive e-commerce database system to demonstrate my SQL and data analytics skills. The project includes a fully normalized database schema with 10 tables, 20+ complex analytical queries, and automated business logic through stored procedures and triggers. I focused on real-world scenarios like customer lifetime value analysis, inventory management, and sales forecasting."

### Technical Deep-Dive Points:

1. **Database Design:**
   - "I implemented third normal form normalization to eliminate data redundancy"
   - "Used proper foreign key relationships to maintain referential integrity"
   - "Created strategic indexes on frequently queried columns to optimize performance"

2. **Complex Queries:**
   - "I utilized window functions like RANK and NTILE for customer segmentation"
   - "Implemented CTEs to improve query readability and maintenance"
   - "Used LAG/LEAD functions for time-series analysis and trend detection"

3. **Business Value:**
   - "Created RFM analysis to segment customers into actionable groups like 'Champions' and 'At Risk'"
   - "Built inventory turnover analysis to identify overstocked and understocked products"
   - "Developed customer churn prediction based on purchase recency patterns"

4. **Automation:**
   - "Implemented triggers to automatically update inventory when orders are placed"
   - "Created stored procedures to standardize order processing logic"
   - "Built views to provide pre-aggregated data for reporting dashboards"

## Common Interview Questions & Answers

**Q: Why did you choose this project?**
A: "I wanted to demonstrate my ability to work with real-world business scenarios. E-commerce involves complex relationships between customers, products, and orders—perfect for showcasing SQL skills like joins, aggregations, and analytical functions. It also allowed me to practice translating business requirements into database solutions."

**Q: What was the most challenging part?**
A: "The most challenging aspect was implementing the RFM analysis using window functions. I had to segment customers into quintiles based on recency, frequency, and monetary value, then combine these scores to create actionable customer segments. It required understanding both the business logic and advanced SQL syntax."

**Q: How would you scale this database?**
A: "For scaling, I would: 1) Implement partitioning on the orders table by date, 2) Add read replicas for analytical queries, 3) Create materialized views for frequently accessed reports, 4) Implement caching for common queries, and 5) Consider moving historical data to a data warehouse."

**Q: What did you learn from this project?**
A: "I learned the importance of proper indexing—my initial queries were slow until I strategically indexed foreign keys and frequently filtered columns. I also learned how to balance normalization with query performance, and when to use views versus CTEs for different use cases."

**Q: Can you explain one complex query?**
A: "My customer retention cohort analysis query groups customers by their first purchase month, then tracks how many return in subsequent months. I used a subquery to calculate the time difference between each order and the customer's first order, then aggregated by cohort to show retention rates over time. This helps identify which customer acquisition periods had the best retention."
